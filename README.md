### Your AI confidant. Lumis helps you capture the small moments from your day, synthesize research into lessons, and turn your real life into content worth sharing.

Tell Lumis about your life, share research you are interested in, and learn to craft your own stories.

#### Lumis will help you find the connections across what you've lived and what you've learned:

- **Define your voice** `/init` walks you through setting up your vault, voice, and personalized content toolkit
- **Captures moments** and identifies the "5-second moment," the instant something shifted
- **Finds connections** to your past moments, things you might not have linked on your own
- **Builds a Pattern Map** in Obsidian that visualizes how your moments relate over time
- **Saves research** from articles, books, and videos with TL;DR companions
- **Captures inspiration** by researching people you admire and connecting them to your vault
- **Reads research aloud** by converting any vault note to narrated audio with ElevenLabs
- **Challenges your thinking** through targeted critical thinking prompts with honest feedback
- **Develops stories** through free writing and guided questions, then shapes them into clean narratives
- **Directs video production** by turning your story into a shot-by-shot timeline, generating avatar clips, and assembling branded video
- **Builds carousels** from stories into card-by-card LinkedIn carousel plans with copy and image direction
- **Writes articles** from stories into full long-form blog posts ready to publish
- **Generates images** for any director format using Google Imagen, with brand-aware prompts that update source files automatically
- **Creates diagrams** from stories as interactive React Flow visualizations, with PNG export for embedding anywhere
- **Cleans AI writing** by detecting and fixing AI vocabulary, filler phrases, em dash overuse, and structural tells
- **Writes YouTube descriptions** optimized for search, click-through, and the first 150 characters above the fold
- **Writes LinkedIn posts** optimized for saves and dwell time, with hooks under 110 characters and proven post structures

This repo is the engine. Your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault is where your moments, stories, and research live. They stay separate so your personal content never ends up in a code repo. Your stories remain private to you.

## How it works

Lumis owns the full content flywheel. Most tools handle one step. Lumis connects all of them because a video director that doesn't know your moments is useless, and a content tool that doesn't know your voice is just another template.

Each step feeds the next. Your moments become the raw material for stories. `/craft-content` finds the story, and the director skills turn it into platform-ready formats.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allthriveai/lumis.git
cd lumis
npm install
npm run build
claude
/init
```

`/init` walks you through choosing your vault path, scaffolds the directory structure, interviews you to populate Voice.md, then copies and personalizes the Amplify toolkit (8 hook types, 18 content structures, persuasion glossary) using your voice. Lumis reads Voice.md at every layer to align moments, stories, and video with your identity.
